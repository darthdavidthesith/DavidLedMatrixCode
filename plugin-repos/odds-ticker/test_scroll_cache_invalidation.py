"""The ticker must rebuild after something else clears its scroll cache.

Regression under test, observed on a live 512x64 rig: the panel intermittently
showed "No odds data" while ESPN was returning games perfectly well. Over three
days of logs there were ten such frames and *zero* occurrences of the two
conditions that message is supposed to mean -- games_data was never empty and
ticker_image was never None. Every one came from
``ScrollHelper.get_visible_portion()`` returning None.

Vegas invalidates a plugin's scroll cache whenever the plugin reports an
update, by setting ``scroll_helper.cached_image`` and ``cached_array`` to None
(``PluginAdapter.invalidate_plugin_scroll_cache``). That is deliberate: it is
what stops last night's live game being redrawn this morning. On the rig it
fired about once a minute.

It cannot clear ``self.ticker_image`` -- that attribute is private to this
plugin. ``display()`` decided whether to rebuild by testing ``ticker_image``
alone, so between the invalidation and this plugin's own next rebuild (an hour
away, ``base_update_interval``, whenever no game is live) it skipped the
rebuild, got None back from the helper, and drew the fallback.

The methods run against a stand-in ``self`` carrying only what display()
touches, with a real ScrollHelper, so the cache behaviour under test is the
real one. Only per-game rendering is stubbed -- it needs fonts and logos and
has nothing to do with this.
