"""
Tests that odds are requested only for games the ticker can actually show.

Regression under test: _fetch_league_games() fetched odds inline for every
game in the future_fetch_days window, then the caller trimmed the list to
max_games_per_league (five by default). Measured on a live rig during a
college-football weekend: 1,281 ESPN requests in twenty minutes, ~600/min,
holding roughly a CPU core on a Pi -- for a ticker showing five games. The
display loop shares the interpreter, and frames stalled for up to half a
second.

The methods are exercised against a stand-in ``self`` rather than a
constructed plugin, so the test needs no display manager, no network and no
cache -- only that manager.py imports.
