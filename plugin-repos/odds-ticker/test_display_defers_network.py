"""display() must not do blocking work on the render thread.

display() runs on the shared display loop. Anything it waits on freezes the
whole rotation -- every plugin, not just this one -- so three separate habits
are pinned here, each of which shipped at some point and each of which was
visible on hardware as a stuttering marquee:

1. Reaching the network inline. _perform_update() calls _fetch_league_games
   and, below it, _fetch_team_rankings, both blocking HTTP.
2. Waiting on a worker thread. Both the data refresh and the scroll-strip
   rebuild were written as `Thread(...).start()` immediately followed by
   `queue.get(timeout=N)` -- a blocking call wearing a thread as a disguise.
   Measured on hardware: single frames of 1.0s, 2.2s and 4.8s against a 10.00ms
   median, with the queue timeouts as ceilings.
3. Re-requesting a deferred refresh every frame. last_update was written only
   inside _perform_update(), so between deferring the work and the work
   landing, the interval stayed elapsed and display() queued another ESPN
   refresh on every frame -- observed firing every 8ms at 100fps.
