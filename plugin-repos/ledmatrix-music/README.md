# Music Player Plugin

![A track playing on a 128x32 panel: album art on the left, then the title,
artist and album stacked beside it](../../docs/assets/ledmatrix-music/hero.png)

*Every image in this README is real plugin output, rendered at the true panel
size from a recorded now-playing payload so it reproduces exactly. The cover
art in them is generated, not a real album cover.*

A plugin for LEDMatrix that displays real-time now playing information from Spotify and YouTube Music with album art, scrolling text, and progress bars.

## Configuration

### Plugin Settings
Use Web Ui to configure


### Configuration Options

Settings live in the plugin's tab in the web UI and in `config/config.json`
under `ledmatrix-music`. The full schema is
[`config_schema.json`](config_schema.json).

### Source and behaviour

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Enable or disable the music player plugin. |
| `display_duration` | `30` | How long to show the music display (10-300 seconds). |
| `preferred_source` | `"spotify"` | Preferred music source — one of `spotify`, `ytm`. |
| `polling_interval_seconds` | `2` | Polling interval for Spotify in seconds (1–60). Advanced. |
| `ytm_companion_url` | `"http://localhost:9863"` | YouTube Music Companion server URL. |
| `spotify_client_id` | — | Spotify API Client ID. Stored as a secret, so the web UI masks it. |
| `spotify_client_secret` | — | Spotify API Client Secret. Stored as a secret, so the web UI masks it. |
| `live_priority` | `false` | Enable live priority - music will interrupt normal display rotation when actively playing. |
| `layout_mode` | `"classic"` | Layout engine. 'classic' is the original fixed-size layout (unchanged). 'adaptive' (beta) scales the title/artist/album fonts to the panel height, growing on large panels and shrinking gracefully on small ones — the album art already scales this way. Your customization fonts and y_percent offsets still apply in adaptive mode. Requires LEDMatrix core with the adaptive layout system; falls back to classic on older cores. Switch back to 'classic' at any time to restore the original rendering — one of `classic`, `adaptive`. Advanced. |
| `progress_bar_match_text` | `true` | Size the progress bar to the widest of the title, artist and album lines instead of stretching it across the whole text area. On a wide panel a short title otherwise leaves a bar spanning the display, which reads as a full-width element in Vegas scroll mode. A line long enough to scroll still fills the bar, since it genuinely fills that width. Turn off for the original full-width bar. Advanced. |

### Marquee scrolling

Each of the three text rows scrolls independently and takes the same five keys.

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `text_scrolling.title.enabled` | `true` | Enable scrolling for track title. Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.title.speed` | `5` | Scroll speed divisor (higher = slower, lower = faster). Controls how many frames between each character scroll. Range: 1-20. Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.title.separator` | `"   "` | Text separator between wrapped text (e.g., '   ' for 3 spaces, ' | ' for pipe). Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.title.initial_pause_frames` | `0` | Number of frames to pause before starting scroll (0 = no pause) (0–300). Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.title.end_pause_frames` | `0` | Number of frames to pause at end before wrapping (0 = no pause) (0–300). Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.artist.enabled` | `true` | Enable scrolling for artist name. Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.artist.speed` | `5` | Scroll speed divisor (higher = slower, lower = faster). Controls how many frames between each character scroll. Range: 1-20. Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.artist.separator` | `"   "` | Text separator between wrapped text (e.g., '   ' for 3 spaces, ' | ' for pipe). Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.artist.initial_pause_frames` | `0` | Number of frames to pause before starting scroll (0 = no pause) (0–300). Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.artist.end_pause_frames` | `0` | Number of frames to pause at end before wrapping (0 = no pause) (0–300). Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.album.enabled` | `true` | Enable scrolling for album name. Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.album.speed` | `5` | Scroll speed divisor (higher = slower, lower = faster). Controls how many frames between each character scroll. Range: 1-20. Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.album.separator` | `"   "` | Text separator between wrapped text (e.g., '   ' for 3 spaces, ' | ' for pipe). Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.album.initial_pause_frames` | `0` | Number of frames to pause before starting scroll (0 = no pause) (0–300). Advanced. |
| `text_scrolling.album.end_pause_frames` | `0` | Number of frames to pause at end before wrapping (0 = no pause) (0–300). Advanced. |

### Fonts and row positions

There are no colour settings — the three rows use fixed shades, as described
under [Color Customization](#color-customization).

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `customization.title_text.font` | `"PressStart2P-Regular.ttf"` | Select the font to use — one of `PressStart2P-Regular.ttf`, `4x6-font.ttf`, `5by7.regular.ttf`, `5x7.bdf`, `4x6.bdf`. Advanced. |
| `customization.title_text.font_size` | `8` | Font size in pixels (4–16). Advanced. |
| `customization.title_text.y_percent` | — | Vertical position override as fraction of display height (0.0=top, 1.0=bottom). Leave empty for automatic positioning based on font size (0.0–1.0). Advanced. |
| `customization.artist_text.font` | `"5x7.bdf"` | Select the font to use (default matches the display manager 5x7 font) — one of `PressStart2P-Regular.ttf`, `4x6-font.ttf`, `5by7.regular.ttf`, `5x7.bdf`, `4x6.bdf`. Advanced. |
| `customization.artist_text.font_size` | `7` | Font size in pixels (4–16). Advanced. |
| `customization.artist_text.y_percent` | — | Vertical position override as fraction of display height (0.0=top, 1.0=bottom). Leave empty for automatic positioning based on font size (0.0–1.0). Advanced. |
| `customization.album_text.font` | `"5x7.bdf"` | Select the font to use (default matches the display manager 5x7 font) — one of `PressStart2P-Regular.ttf`, `4x6-font.ttf`, `5by7.regular.ttf`, `5x7.bdf`, `4x6.bdf`. Advanced. |
| `customization.album_text.font_size` | `7` | Font size in pixels (4–16). Advanced. |
| `customization.album_text.y_percent` | — | Vertical position override as fraction of display height (0.0=top, 1.0=bottom). Leave empty for automatic positioning based on font size (0.0–1.0). Advanced. |


### What the rows look like

![The three text rows on a 128x32 and a 128x64 panel](../../docs/assets/ledmatrix-music/rows.png)

Album art takes the full panel height on the left; the title, artist and album
stack in the space that is left. A row too wide for that space marquee-scrolls
rather than truncating:

![The title part-way through its marquee](../../docs/assets/ledmatrix-music/scrolling.png)

`progress_bar_match_text` decides how far the playback bar runs. On a wide
panel a short title otherwise leaves a bar stretched across the display:

## Authentication Setup

### Spotify Authentication

1. **Create Spotify App**:
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Create a new app
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret
   - Set Redirect URI to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`, the plugin's default. Another URL works if you set `spotify_redirect_uri` to the same value

2. **Configure Credentials**:
   Add to `config/config_secrets.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "ledmatrix-music": {
       "spotify_client_id": "your_client_id_here",
       "spotify_client_secret": "your_client_secret_here",
       "spotify_redirect_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback"
     }
   }
   ```

   > Older configs that put these under a `"music"` key with
   > `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` (uppercase) still work — `spotify_client.py`
   > falls back to that legacy form — but new installs should use the
   > `"ledmatrix-music"` key with lowercase names shown above.

3. **Run Authentication**:
   ```bash
   cd plugins/ledmatrix-music
   python3 authenticate_spotify.py
   ```
   - Follow the prompts to authorize in your browser
   - Copy the redirected URL back to the script
   - Token will be saved to `config/spotify_auth.json`

### YouTube Music Authentication

1. **Install YTM Desktop App**:
   - Download from [YTM Desktop](https://github.com/ytmdesktop/ytmdesktop)
   - Install and run the application
   - Enable the Companion Server in settings

2. **Configure YTM URL**:
   Update your config if using a different port:
   ```json
   {
     "ledmatrix-music": {
       "ytm_companion_url": "http://localhost:9863"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Run Authentication**:
   ```bash
   cd plugins/ledmatrix-music
   python3 authenticate_ytm.py
   ```
   - The script will request an auth code
   - Approve the request in YTM Desktop App within 30 seconds
   - Token will be saved to `config/ytm_auth.json`
   - Each installation registers with a unique app ID (a random hex code appended to
     `LEDMatrixController`), so authenticating multiple LEDMatrix displays against the
     same YTM Desktop App won't overwrite each other's authorization

## Display Format

The music display shows:

- **Album Art**: Square album artwork on the left side
- **Track Title**: Scrolling white text at the top
- **Artist**: Scrolling gray text in the middle
- **Album**: Scrolling light gray text below artist
- **Progress Bar**: White progress bar at the bottom
- **Nothing Playing**: Centered message when no music is detected

### Adaptive Layout (beta)

Set `"layout_mode": "adaptive"` to scale the title/artist/album fonts to
your panel height — the same way the album art already scales
(`album_art_size = matrix_height`). On a tall panel the text grows right
along with the artwork instead of staying at a fixed size.

```json
{
  "layout_mode": "adaptive"
}
```

- The default is `"classic"`: rendering is completely unchanged unless you
  opt in. **To revert at any time, set it back to `"classic"`** — no
  reinstall needed.
- Your font and vertical-position (`y_percent`) customizations still apply
  in adaptive mode: an explicitly configured font/font_size for
  `title_text`/`artist_text`/`album_text` wins over the automatic sizing.
- Since text still scrolls when it's too wide for the panel, fonts are
  sized by height only (title/artist/album each get an equal share of the
  vertical space above the progress bar) — width never forces the font
  smaller the way it might on a scoreboard.
- Requires a LEDMatrix core with the adaptive layout system
  (`docs/ADAPTIVE_LAYOUT.md`); older cores silently keep the classic layout.
