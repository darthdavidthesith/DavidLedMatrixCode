"""Tests that an unreachable YTM Companion is retried quietly, not hammered.

Regression under test: the poll loop asked the client to reconnect every cycle
(~2s), the client always tried, and each attempt logged two ERROR lines. On a
live device whose companion was simply not running that produced **13,298 error
lines in 12 hours** -- 99.8% of everything the device logged -- which buries
every other error in the journal. The records also went to the root logger via
bare `logging.error(...)`, so they appeared as "root" and sat outside the
plugin's own log level, leaving no way to quiet them.

"The companion app is not running" is an ordinary state, not a fault.

Run: <core-venv>/bin/python plugins/ledmatrix-music/test_ytm_reconnect_backoff.py
