"""Smoke test: the entry point imports and declares the class the manifest names.

Cheap, but it catches the two failures that stop a plugin loading at all --
a syntax error, and a manifest whose ``class_name`` no longer matches the code.
The second is not hypothetical: this file used to import a hardcoded
``BasketballPluginManager``, a name the plugin had long since stopped using, so
it failed on every run for a reason that had nothing to do with the plugin. It
now reads the name from the manifest, which is the thing the loader actually
uses, so a rename is either reflected in both places or caught here.

Needs the core on the path for ``src.plugin_system.base_plugin``; run via
scripts/run_plugin_tests.py, which supplies it.

Exit codes: 0 pass, 2 skip (no core), 1 fail.
