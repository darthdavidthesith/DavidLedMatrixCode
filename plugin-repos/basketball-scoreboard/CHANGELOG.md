# Changelog

## [1.35.0] - 2026-09-24

### Changed
- **13 config control(s) that cannot affect anything are no longer drawn.**
  Each stays declared — `"x-display": "hidden"` — so a config already carrying
  it keeps validating and nothing is lost on upgrade; only the form control goes
  away.

  - `other_games_divisions` (×4) — the FBS / FCS / Other checkboxes. ESPN
    publishes those group rosters for **college football and nothing else**
    (`_DIVISION_GROUPS_BY_LEAGUE`), so here the lookup resolves nothing, the
    filter fails open, and no combination of boxes could change one game.
  - `other_games_min_quality` (×2) — "ranked" needs a poll. Without one the
    rank table stays empty and the check fails open, so the setting has
    exactly one meaningful value.
  - `display_options.show_ranking` (×2) — **worse than inert.** The rank table
    is always empty without a poll, and the badge *replaces* the record — so
    ticking it silently erased the records `show_records` was drawing.
  - `scroll_settings.scroll_delay` (×4) — its own description has read "Kept
    so saved configs still load; ignored" for releases, yet it was still an
    editable number. `scroll_speed` is the only pacing control.
  - `customization.layout.ranking` (×1) — no reader anywhere. The rank badge
    shares the records row and is positioned by `customization.layout.record`.

  Left visible where the league genuinely publishes a poll: `ncaam`, `ncaaw`.

### Fixed
- **The rankings fetch ran on leagues that publish no poll.**
  `_league_has_rankings` gated the quality-filter call site but not the
  `show_ranking` ones, so ticking Show Ranking on NBA and WNBA sent two requests
  an hour to endpoints that cannot answer. The gate moved to the top of
  `_fetch_team_rankings`, where it covers every caller and cannot drift apart
  again.

  Which leagues have a poll is **measured, not assumed** — ESPN's `/rankings`
  was probed for every scoreboard league on 2026-09-24. college-football (125
  teams), men's and women's college basketball (50 each), college hockey (4/5)
  and college lacrosse (28/33) answer 200 with real poll blocks; every
  professional league answers 404, and so does college baseball.

## [1.34.1] - 2026-09-17

### Changed
- **The bundled ESPN date helper fetches its chunks concurrently.** Since ESPN
  began rejecting `dates=YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD`, a season is fetched as one request
  per month, and a month over the 500-event cap becomes one per day -- about
  130 requests for four busy months of college baseball, previously issued one
  at a time (17.7s on a Pi 4; 2.6-3.3s now). This does not change the
  `update() timed out` lines some boots log: those are core's shared 20s
  startup budget running out, and the data still lands a tick later.
  Measured on a Pi 4 against live ESPN with run order alternated: one college-baseball month 5.3s before, 1.5-1.8s after; two
  capped months (63 requests, 3101 events) 6.4-7.5s before, 1.1-2.1s after.
  Same requests, same events, and merged events keep their existing order.
  A truncated month is dropped as soon as it is seen, so peak memory during a
  cold season fetch rises about 16 MB rather than 43 MB.
  Synced from LEDMatrix core ChuckBuilds/LEDMatrix#596.

## [1.34.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added
- **Live games poll at the live interval.** The plugin implements
  `get_update_interval()`: while a game is in progress the core calls `update()`
  every `live_update_interval` seconds instead of at the static interval (the
  manifest's 60s, or `update_interval_seconds` where the manifest declares
  none). With nothing live it returns no opinion, so the idle cadence is
  unchanged. The Vegas cards and modes not on screen no longer lag behind the
  score.
- **Settings saved in the web UI apply without a restart.** `on_config_change`
  rebuilds the league managers, registry, scroll manager and rotation from the
  new config, so league enables, durations, live priority, display modes and
  favorites take effect immediately. A save that omits `enabled` keeps the
  current state.

### Changed
- **Requires LEDMatrix core 3.4.0**, the first release that consults
  `get_update_interval()` (ChuckBuilds/LEDMatrix#555).
- **`scroll_settings.scroll_delay` is documented as ignored.** It never affected
  scrolling (frames are paced to the panel refresh and `scroll_speed` sets the
  speed) but was described as a smoothness knob. The key stays declared so saved
  configs keep loading.

### Fixed
- **Live scores are no longer up to 5 minutes stale.** The live scoreboard
  behind the NBA, WNBA, NCAAM and NCAAW live managers was cached for 300s
  whatever `live_update_interval` said; it is now 30s, as in soccer, afl and
  nrl.
- **Switch-only installs no longer run the 125 FPS loop.** `enable_scrolling`
  was true whenever the scroll manager could be built, so the default all-switch
  config re-rendered a static scorebug every 8ms. The high-FPS loop is now
  requested only when a mode is actually set to scroll
  (`_has_any_scroll_mode()`, as football/afl/nrl/soccer do).
- **Scroll mode no longer freezes while a fetch runs.** The per-frame live
  refresh ran `manager.update()` on the render thread, so when a fetch was due
  the marquee stalled for the whole ESPN request. It is handed to a worker
  thread (one per manager at a time, at least 5s apart; the manager's own
  interval still decides whether anything is fetched).
- **Switch mode refreshes its managers off the render thread.** The draw-time
  refresh in `_try_manager_display()` ran inline, freezing the panel for each
  due fetch; it now uses the same worker dispatch as afl/nrl/soccer.

## [1.33.2] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed
- **Scores and schedules load again after ESPN stopped accepting date
  ranges.** Since 2026-09-15 ESPN answers `dates=YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD` scoreboard
  queries with `400 Bad Request` for every sport. Today's games, the
  lookback/lookahead window and the season schedule are all ranges, so the
  NBA and WNBA boards logged `400 Client Error` and showed nothing. A rejected
  range is now fetched by `fetch_espn_scoreboard` (`basketball_espn_dates.py`, a
  copy of LEDMatrix core's `src/common/espn_dates.py`) as whole months plus the
  days at either end, which cover the window exactly: a season is 8 to 12
  requests. A month that comes back at ESPN's 500-event cap is re-fetched day by
  day, and after one rejection ranges go straight to chunks for 6 hours.
- **`limit=1000` silently truncated results.** Above 500 ESPN returns a short
  list with no error (college football: 25 of 68 games for one Saturday).
  Scoreboard requests now send at most 500.
- **Older cores.** A core whose background service cannot fetch ranges (before
  ChuckBuilds/LEDMatrix#591 added `handles_espn_date_ranges`) would send the
  season range to ESPN as-is, so the plugin fetches the season itself during
  `update()` instead. `SportsCore._get_weeks_data` is carried here for the same
  reason.

## [1.33.1] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed
- **A null period no longer stops live games updating.** The live check that
  drops games which look finished compared `game.get("period", 0) >= 4`; that
  default only covers a missing key, so a scheduled, halftime or postponed game whose ESPN `status.period`
  was null raised `TypeError` (a `None` period text likewise raised
  `AttributeError`). `SportsLive.update()` does not catch it, so that league's
  whole live refresh was abandoned: live games already on the panel kept their
  last scores, new ones never appeared, and the error repeated on every poll
  while that game stayed in the feed. A null or non-numeric period now
  counts as 0 and a null or non-string period text as empty; thresholds and
  clock handling are unchanged. ESPN normally sends an integer, so this takes a
  malformed feed.

## [1.33.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- `scroll_card.switch_show_date` / `switch_show_time` for the full-screen
  upcoming scorebug (default on), so the scroll-card toggles no longer blank it
  (port of #342).
- Advanced per-league `odds_update_interval` (default 3600) and
  `live_odds_update_interval` (default 60). The code already read them, but
  they were undeclared and never forwarded to the managers.

### Fixed
- **Postponed, cancelled and suspended games no longer show as "Final 0-0"**
  on Recent. `is_final` now requires a completed, played game, and the period
  text shows ESPN's own label for these games.
- **Full-screen odds no longer overprint the top-centre text.** With only an
  O/U, it was centred on the row holding "Final", the quarter or "Next Game".
  It is now anchored left, and the odds step down a row on collision, as the
  scroll cards already do. A home spread of 0.0 is no longer treated as
  missing, and a non-numeric top-level spread no longer drops the whole line.
- **"Logo Error" is drawn instead of a black panel** at all three fallback
  sites (live, upcoming, recent).
- **Vegas cards follow the game data.** They are rebuilt when the slate's
  signature changes (previously only when empty). They are read from the
  dedicated 'mixed' display and rendered without hijacking the active
  standalone scroll. No network on that path.
- **One failing league no longer takes the others down.** Each league is
  initialised in its own try. A failed league's managers are None, and
  update() skips them instead of raising AttributeError every tick.
- A cached "no odds" marker is a cache hit again instead of refetching.
- Decoded-logo caches in `sports.py` and `game_renderer.py` are bounded LRUs
  (port of core #559).
- Upcoming games are trimmed to `schedule_lookahead_days`, the dwell clock
  resets when a mode comes back on screen, and games the other-games rotation
  swaps in get odds (ports of #345, #343).
- `other_games_divisions` is passed through raw, so a hand-edited string no
  longer becomes a list of letters and `null` no longer blanks the plugin.
- `test_mode` is forwarded to the managers.
- A config `Infinity` no longer crashes init (`OverflowError` in
  `_clamp_window` / `_setting_int`).

### Changed
- Behaviour change: `scroll_card.show_date` / `show_time` no longer hide the
  date and time on the full-screen upcoming scorebug (they did since #336). A
  config that turned them off shows the date/time there again; turn off
  `switch_show_date` / `switch_show_time` to hide them.
- The core floor stays at 3.3.0. `sports.py` imports `src.common.sports_shared`,
  which first shipped in core v3.3.1, but that release still reports
  `__version__ = "3.3.0"`, so a 3.3.1 floor would refuse every current core.
- Removed the unused bundled `logo_downloader.py`; `sports.py` already imports
  `src.logo_downloader`.
- `test_settings_reach_the_manager.py` builds its probes from
  `config_schema.json`, with an allowlist that gives a reason for each key
  consumed outside the league managers.

## [1.32.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- **Favorite games get extra turns in switch mode.** New game-limit setting
  `favorite_rotation_boost` (1-5, default 1): a favorite team's recent or
  upcoming card gets that many turns per rotation for every one turn other
  cards get, its extra turns spread evenly around the loop and kept apart
  whenever enough other cards remain to separate them. Previously only live
  games could weight favorites.

  Existing configs are unaffected: at the default of 1 every card is shown
  once per rotation, in the same order as before.

## [1.31.0] - 2026-09-11

### Added
- **Style each card separately.** Font, size, colour and position for the
  score, clock, team abbreviation, status, detail, odds and ranking can now
  differ between the live, upcoming and recent cards. Set them under
  "Per-Mode Overrides" in the plugin's settings; anything left blank follows
  the settings above it, so a single change applies to one card and leaves
  the others alone.

  Existing configs are unaffected: with no per-mode overrides set, every card
  renders exactly as before -- verified against the golden images at all
  eight panel sizes.

## [1.30.1] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **Live score updates now actually reach the scrolling strip.**
  1.41.0 added the rebuild-on-change machinery but wired it in the wrong order,
  which left it inert: the rebuild decision is computed by fingerprinting the
  live managers' cached games, and the only call that refreshed those managers
  (_ensure_manager_updated) sat INSIDE the block that decision gates. So once
  the first strip was built nothing refreshed the data, the fingerprint could
  never change, and the block never ran again -- the same frozen-until-restart
  symptom the previous release set out to fix. Switch mode was never affected
  because _try_manager_display() refreshes unconditionally on every pass; scroll
  mode now gets the same guarantee, refreshing the live managers before it
  fingerprints them. _ensure_manager_updated() is itself interval-guarded, so on
  frames where no refresh is due this costs two getattrs and a comparison.
  Ported across all eight scoreboards in one change, per CLAUDE.md non-
  negotiable #7, and pinned by a test that asserts the ordering structurally --
  reversing the two lines leaves every behavioural test passing while the panel
  silently freezes.

## [1.30.0] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **Live games now reach the scrolling strip mid-cycle.**
  The strip was rendered once per scroll cycle and _scroll_prepared was cleared
  only when the cycle completed, so a score changed while the marquee was
  running stayed frozen in the pixels until it finished -- minutes, for a long
  game list. Restarting the display forced a rebuild, which is the workaround
  users were finding. The strip is now rebuilt when anything the card draws
  changes, keeping scroll_position and total_distance_scrolled so the marquee
  does not snap back to the start and the cycle still completes on schedule. The
  game clock deliberately does not trigger a rebuild -- it ticks every second
  and re-rendering every card that often is the whole frame budget on a Pi --
  and rebuilds are floored at 5s so a large slate cannot thrash. Ported across
  all eight scoreboards in one change, per CLAUDE.md non-negotiable #7. Rebuild
  frequency is self-limiting: the floor between rebuilds scales with what the
  last one actually cost, so the marquee never spends more than about 5% of its
  time frozen re-rendering. Measured on a Pi 4, a strip rebuild takes 29ms for
  one game and 463ms for fifteen; a fixed floor would have been fine for the
  first and wrong for the second. Also fixes the rebuild-cost bookkeeping being
  keyed differently from where it is read, which left the duty-cycle cap inert
  in most plugins.
## [1.29.7] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- **Placeholder team logos draw their abbreviation at PressStart2P 16, not 12.**
  That face is crisp only at multiples of 8; 12 was anti-aliased, and 16 is the
  nearest crisp size for the 64px logo tile. Panel text was already on-grid via
  `_FONT_PIXEL_GRID` and is unchanged.

## [1.24.3] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **Recent games now get their odds.** `SportsUpcoming` fetches odds for the games that survive selection and `SportsLive` fetches them per included game — the Recent screen never fetched them at all, so its "odds if available" renderer never had anything attached and every final rendered bare. `update()` now fetches odds for the selected finals, exactly as Upcoming does; ESPN keeps a completed game's closing line on the same endpoint, so a final is as answerable as an upcoming game. Same fix as football-scoreboard 2.29.3 — which only surfaced there because football's display-path rotation attached odds to rotated-in finals by accident; this plugin has no such rotation, so its finals were bare in every configuration. Pinned by `test_recent_games_get_odds.py`.
